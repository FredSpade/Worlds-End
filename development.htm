<FONT COLOR="#007700">
** Archer class renamed "Toxophilite: One who shoots with, or is skilled in the use of, a bow and arrow."  
<P>
** New defensive items for ninja class: Kunai and Mamori fuda found at the Ninjutsu shop in TBS  
<P>
** Shiverton town overhauled
<BR>
Featuring new scene art, scripts and characters. Shiverton still has something of the ghost town about it, but it's population has begun to grow and the local facilities accordingly.
<BR>
Being the gateway to the icy wastes proper, this is always going to be a cold snowy place, and access is now only available by skirting round the foot of Mount Gargan.
<P>
** Gargan completely updated
<BR>
Introducing a brand new look with much new artwork, some scene updates.
<BR>
Being on the edge of the icy wastes to the far northwest, Gargan catches much snow at it's windy summit which eventually thaws into cold, fast-flowing streams that snake down the dark, wet forested mountainside below. This is a largely unforgiving environment featuring a few insubstantial caves and some roaming wild animals.
<P>
** Gemstone mine updated with some new artwork, scene tweaks and other tidbits
<P>
** New race: gnomes
<BR>
These seem to be a more permanent replacement for the dwarves and ill-fated manics. They may be encountered in out of the way areas such as deep forests or underground caves and also in 'magical' places. Gnomes are mostly peaceful, playful and clever but some can be suspicious, defensive and even aggressive.  
<P>
** New monsters: wild boar (common), giant rabbit (rare) and snowman (drops icecreams!)
<P>
** New skin for the bear monster
<P>
** Reaper level boosted from 99 (lame) to 222 (respectable) but they are now encountered just one at a time
<P>
** Pink/fluffy rabbit monster removed
<BR>
It's cousin the white rabbit has been modified to be the same level and has replaced it in the Training Grounds
<P>
** No-flee flags updated for monsters
<BR>
This is based on common sense. Therefore, ants or wasps will never flee but rats or owls might. Also, just because something is undead does not necessarily mean it would never flee: stupid aggressive skeletons, for instance, will never flee, whereas shades, vampires and apparitions may do so (since they are more clever). Humanoids will mostly flee if they feel the need as would most animals, but things such as slimes or graspwoods (animated trees) will not since they have no minds and thus would show no fear. The result of all this is that by far the most common reaction from most monsters *would* be to flee.
<P>
** Chance of falling out of the sky reduced from 20% to 10%
<P>
** Certain other developments, graphical and/or conceptual improvements, quest, stat, link or scene changes and other minor, forgotten-right-now or secretive changes ;-)

** Major 'urbans' update and other related developments
<BR>
Introducing a complete re-organization of all the humanoid monsters found in the main city areas, including all new  monsters and skins, the removal or reinvention of a few old monsters or skins and updates of levels and cash drops.
<BR>
The amount of coins found after fights is still linked to the monster's level, except now there may be an adjustment according to how rich that humanoid would realistically be. Some examples are: the new punks and thugs tend to have below average cash for their level, whereas dudes and blokes tend to carry average coins, and cops and mobsters will have above average amounts on them. 
<P>
** New scene actors
<BR>
Some necessary scene updates to reflect the monster changes such as guards becoming cops etc. Also you may recognise some of the new humanoid monsters since the skins are being used as actors they might as well be used to their fullest potential.
<P>
** New random encounter: ambush by robbers!
<BR>
This currently occurs in two particular hotspots: the north and west roads in and out of Traveller's Junction.
<BR> 
Firstly, there is a 20% chance of an encounter, but this could simply be with some minor to medium strength wild animal. If not the encounter may be an ambush consisting of one, two or three robbers. If they win the fight they will take any coins they find (banknotes and other items shall remain untouched). If you are joined to a PARTY of players or are the leader of one, as long as the party wins ie. has at least one surviving member, no coins will be taken since the robbers are vanquished.
<BR>
If the robbers are defeated, as well as any usual finds (ie. cash drops or meat etc) there will also be found either a witches brew, a genuine VIP pass or a large sapphire worth 50k!
<P>
** Transport Stations update
<BR>
VIP passes are no longer taken when using these services, instead a payment may be made in cash and the VIP pass need just be shown for travellers and party leaders to qualify for a ride.
<P>
** Jail update
<BR>
No more being thrown in jail unfairly, nor will jail remove all your cash. Now you will mostly wind up in jail if you are caught fighting city gate guards (20% chance) or messing around in the castle, but prison scum are no longer allowed the privelage of VIP status and their passes will be removed. Don't get bitten by rats or picked on by bullies in the jail now will you? 
<P>
** Shadow boots quest update
<BR>
This includes new skins for the actors and some new script to reflect who those actors now are ;-) 
<P>
** Streetfight class weapons moved from Blaggar's Market to the Junk Shop
<P>
** Sonic shield renamed as Cymbal Shield with new art image and stats
<P>
** Shinobi shield renamed as Nekode
<P>
** Some new scene backgrounds added
<P>
** Some of the main buttons artwork updated
<P>
** All known bugs killed
<P>
** Certain other developments, graphical and/or conceptual improvements, quest, stat, link or scene changes and other minor, forgotten-right-now or secretive changes ;-)

** General hand class update
<BR>
Any (current) class can now wield sword, street, gun and archery weapons, although if they are not a specialist in these hand classes they may be more limited than those who are specialists
<BR>
Some examples of deviations from this would be the Ninja who can train as high as the specialists in their alternate hand skills; also the Hippy class are unlimited in both Sonics and Pagan
<P>
** General update for all classes of training level titles
<P>
** Samurai roumaji updated
<BR>
This means, for example, the authentic samurai training or weapon names follow the longer versions of their spellings
<P>
** Samurai shield is now the Kote
<P>
** New item for archers: Bracer - an alternative defence equipable
<P>
** Major overhaul of ken weapon class items
<BR>
There are fewer than before. Stats have been reconfigured and new artwork added. 
<P>
** Major overhaul of archery weapon class items
<BR>
There are fewer than before. Stats have been reconfigured and new artwork added. 
<P>
** Drow class gets two new exclusive weapons: Sithyrr at levels 20 and 99 both for sale in The Groves area (and for now the level 20 weapon can also be bought from the archery shop in TBS
<P>
** Deadlands area updated
<BR> 
A new map image for the Deadlands has been added along with a few other minor changes.
<BR>
This version also introduces 'the climb into and out of The Pit area'. Rather than simply passing straight through a link between the Deadlands and The Pit, some new script now allows the player some choices including climbing.
<BR>
It works like this: if climbing boots or the Uber boots are EQUIPPED, the climb up or down will (at least for now) always be successful. Otherwise, there is a reasonable random chance the lack of proper equipment will be reason for falling. There is also a good chance the player may overcome this, however only after harsh tests of agility and dexterity would the ill-equipped manage a successful climb.
<BR>
Although the current stat test is admittedly harsh, most players going there would be either quite high level or perhaps unwise to be out in the Deadlands in the first place..
<BR>
Falling = -1975 HP and only the dead go free ;-)  
<P> 
** New City University map image and minor changes to this area
<BR>
This includes a 10% chance of finding some coins in the fountain
<P>
** The Underground nightclub is now renamed as Das Unterwelt
<P> 
** Slot machine win chances and game prizes updated
<BR>
It's now possible to win anything from 25 coins to a million
<P>
** Grease spell roughly reworked as 'Fumble' featuring new animated graphic
<P>
** All known bugs killed
<P>
** Certain other developments, graphical and/or conceptual improvements, quest, stat, link or scene changes and other minor, forgotten-right-now or secretive changes ;-)

<FONT COLOR="#007700">
<FONT SIZE=4>
** New stock for investment at GREED Inc: Adult Prawn Productions
<BR>
For the hardcore prawn enthusiast
<P>
** Huge update for Easthaven, Training Grounds and the Arena including:
<BR>
Lots of new scenes, actors (there's more interactivity with these) and new artwork
<BR>
Basic training and a FREE rez (to 1 HP) have been added to the arena which itself is now more user friendly
<BR>
Weapons can now be found in the arena too, as well as new items: rings and amulets of might and vitality
<BR>
Questor has gone and the loaded dice (now called lucky dice) are found somewhere else in Easthaven
<BR>
The old quest to kill 10 ants has now become 'exterminator work' which you can do as many times as you like (report to the new Town Hall to do this)
<BR>
New delivery work also available at the Town Hall
<P>
** Mage staves updated
<BR>
This is primarily a cosmetic update for these. For example, the staff that casts a Fireball spell is renamed as Staff of Fireball, is given an image that reflects it's affinity to fire, and has a more succint description. This update applies to all Mage staves
<P>
** Pagan weapons updated
<BR>
This is a complete overhaul for these. The point is simply to reconceptualize them to reflect the druid class's affinity to nature.
<BR>
This means all-new artwork both for the items themselves and their attack animations, plus some new sound effects
<P>
** Certain Ninja and Samurai item/class specific enhancements
<BR>
This is primarily training level title or equipment name updates for authenticity 
<P>
** Quest for witches brew ingredients moved to westwych with pet black cat as reward
<BR>
This pet cannot be gained in any other way, and it can cast spells of all elements including life! You will have to train it somewhat since it has just one level for each of its nine lives ;-) 
<P>
** Updated healing at fountain in City University
<BR>
This will not only rez you now but also (gradually) fill up your HP
<P>
** Woodford Ferry has dropped in price from 1000 to 500 coins and is now free to VIP holders
<P>
** Lots of new link image artwork and some new scene backgrounds scattered around
<P>
** Chance of falling out of the sky reduced from 40% to 20%
<P>
** Fixed Gold Knuckle not being given as fight reward in Lenny's Place
<P>
** Fixed studs being found when they shouldn't be :-P

** Certain other developments, graphical and/or conceptual improvements, quest, stat, link or scene changes and other minor, forgotten-right-now or secretive changes ;-)

<P>
** Brackmire area updated featuring new artwork
<P>
** Major updates to bar scenes featuring new actors, scripts, artwork and inter-activity
<P>
** Removed: staves that cast 'affects all' spells
<BR>
This is due to a WoS engine limitation that made it impossible for these items to work correctly
<BR>
These items may reappear in the future in a new guise
<P>
** New monster: shrimp
<P>
** New actor skins
<P>

<FONT SIZE=4>
Highlights:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>
<FONT COLOR="#007700">
** IMPORTANT:
<BR>
Please ensure all your old characters are NOT on maps called The Ancient Way, The Westward Way or The Orc Tunnels, since these maps have been removed or radically changed
<P>
** New sound schemes: owls hoot in the woods, caves drip, bloodworms creep around :-)

Let's hope you hold your nerve when rocks suddenly fall or you hear scary noises..  
<P>
** New maps: The East Tunnels
<P>
** New map image and general minor updates for The Groves area
<P>
** Scenes, FX and monsters in The Crag area revamped
<P>
** New bank notes: 20K and 100K
<BR>
Players with old characters may find they already have some of these new banknotes. 
<BR>
This is because these items were developed out of old items that were removed.
<BR>
This is partly to save item ID numbers but mostly to reward long term players for their commitment.
<BR>
I have done this before and I will most likely do it again :-)
<P>
** A new item, a 'jail guide' available at Blagger's Market
<P>
** Cookbook now fully functional
<P>
** The Fresher's password now gets you into The Groves area as opposed to just one particular scene there
<P>
** The level 99 fast shoes are renamed as Running Shoes and are now gained in a new short quest found in Brackmire
<P>
** New monster skins: arachne, wasp, wolf, creeper and many more.. these are vastly improved thanks to Tansy!
<P>
** New monsters such as blood worm, raven, shambler, bladder plant, dark ogre, grabber tree and many, many more found all over the place..
<P>
** Updated items, interface buttons and other artwork
<P>

<P>
** New class-specific items such as Cans (music helm thingy)
<P>
** Certain items' stat developments or graphical and conceptual improvements
<P>
** All classes now have the ability to use streetfight class weapons (just not as well as those that are specialised)
<BR>
 (In future versions this may apply to certain other weapon classes.)
<P>
** You can now gain a weapon as a reward when fighting in Lenny's place
<P>
** Added free streetfight weapon to somewhere in Easthaven
<P>
** Removal of more junk items
<P>
** Bez and Wiffer have finally made it back to Main Street!
<P>
** Insult and fight gate guards
<P>

<P>
** New monster to fight in the arena.
<P>

Welcome to World's End 1.34
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>
New feature: day and night in Traveller's Junction!

The change over occurs every hour in order for most players to see it in action.

Expect some slight changes to the place depending on the time of day, such as the types of monster lurking around.
<P>
Campfire feature has been improved.
<P>
New images for antidote and witches brew items.
<P>
New item: 'afgan coat' (for hippie class).
<P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>
New class: Hippie

16th July 2003
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>
v1.31 and bug fixer v1.32 are finally available!
<P>
Many new graphics and changes to the majority of spells, however NO SPELLS HAVE BEEN REMOVED from old characters - 
if the spell changed you will simply have the updated version (which may have a new look, name, or sounds).
<P>
Map removed: 'North Woodford'. This map has now been amalgamated into 'South Woodford' to make 'Woodford'.
<BR>
BE SURE TO REMOVE ANY CHARACTERS FROM THE OLD NORTH WOODFORD MAP 
<BR>
BEFORE INSTALLING VERSIONS 1.31 AND 1.32  
<P>
New map layout: the previous layout roughly followed that of the old 'main map' so as to minimise confusion for older players.
<BR>
However, these days the old 'main map' is irrelevant and the layout shall change according to what seems best for the world as it is now.
<BR>
This means 'Brackmire' is now found further north thus bringing the map into the game more. 
<BR>
Also, links to and from various other maps have changed a little which I think you will agree opens the world up nicely.
<BR>
In other words, it is now possible to get to certain places from various directions and the player can choose their preferred route.
<P>
New scene backgrounds in TBS and possibly elsewhere.
<P>
New 'meat pie' item image.
<P>
Slight boost to stats for 'breath boot' and 'shadow boot' items and 'breath boot quest' updated and relocated.
<P>
New basic water terrain item now in shoe shop, and new higher stat ring and amulet in mage shop 
<BR>
(this is so player can choose between more attack or more defence).
<P>
By popular demand: overall monster exp value reduced.
<P>
Bug fixes: many broken links have been fixed in the 'Gnarl Forest' that meant recent players hadn't seen all there was to see, 
<BR>
or indeed, couldn't complete one of the quests. 
<P>
-
<P>
19th April 2003
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>
v1.30 is now available.
<BR>
This version is predominantly a fixer for a number of bugs in v1.29 and some older bugs.
<BR>
Hopefully, this will mean that v1.30 is pretty much bug-free, although having made this version once it had to be redone from memory due to a computer reformat :(
<BR>
Also, there are some new specialised shield items for Samurai, Ninja, Musician and Outcast, plus the regular shield images have been updated to non-Evergreen images.
<P>
-
<P>
21st March 2003
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>
v1.29 is now available for your pleasure.
<BR>
This version introduces a new horse concept, a new map 'The Foothills', plus radical changes to the 'Smokey Castle' map, a replacement 'Sky' map, and removes 'Royal Estate' map. 
<BR>
PLEASE BE SURE TO REMOVE ANY CHARACTERS FROM THESE MAPS BEFORE INSTALLING WE v1.29 
<BR>
Changes and additions include some new items, lots of new artwork,  a number of new monsters, new scenes, sounds, a new quest, plus all known bugs fixed.
<P>
-
<P>
11th February 2003
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>
v1.28 is now available.
<BR>
This version introduces some pretty radical changes to the layout of the maps, as well as completely removing some. 
<BR>
The point is to rid the world of the concept of the 'main map', it resembled a small island rather than a WORLD. 
<BR>
Changes and additions include new items, artwork, midis, monsters, scenes, a new mini-quest and all known bugs fixed.
<BR>
Also in this version are special equips for archer, samurai, ninja and drow.
<BR>
Druid class loses spirit element attack spells but gains those of the air element.
<BR>
There may be many other changes not mentioned here, it's hard to remember everything.

<FONT SIZE=4>
v1.27 is now available.
<BR>
This was put out pretty quick to fix the horse (fast terrain item) and up the given exp a little.
<BR>
It also includes a second draft of the town Woodford (which introduces 2 new maps and removes the crabby one).
<BR>
There is at least one nice new tunnel scene background, one new monster (found by ponds..), a new sfx, improvements to Winged Shoe and Sneaker items, and all known bugs fixed.
<BR>
And I didn't get much sleep last night 0o

Version 1.23 is out!
<BR>
A whole lot of bugs are now thankfully fixed. Wasn't v1.22 bloody awful? Eww!
<BR>
The reworking of items has been tightened up, which probably means there's a bit of a shock in store for players who started in v1.22.
<BR>
If you DID start in v1.22, this is how this world really is!
<BR>
I hope you enjoy this version. If you have any comments, problems or suggestions use the link to the WE boards below.

Version 1.22 is out
<BR>
The promised bug-fix (v1.21) had a bug, so now we're on v1.22
<BR>
Also it's a MAJOR reworking of many items in the world, which probably makes the world easier for newbies.
<BR>
Hopefully there will be no reason to update the world again for a while and the dust can settle and everyone can catch up.
<BR>
One slight bug in v1.22 is on the scrolling credits it says it's v1.21. Hope this isn't too confusing but it's not really worth the trouble of making a new version just to counter that!

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>
Version 1.2 is out!
<BR>
It features new quests and artwork and some nice features such as random encounters with actors in towns, and more interactivity with characters. Hopefully things will also be less confusing to newbies.
<BR>
A slight bug-fix will be available soon.

After taking a short break from WoS I am back doing what I do - "Yippeeee!" from nobody :-)
<BR>
As you can see the site has been updated in anticipation of a brand new version of the world. Version 1.20 will go public in a week or two.
<BR>
With the release of WoS a68 it has now become more difficult to flee from monster attacks. This has resulted in WE becoming slightly more difficult than it was before.
<BR>
Now you must flee before the enemy begins their next attack. We shall see the extent of this before changing anything prematurely.
