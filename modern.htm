Pre-release Development Phases 1 and 2
<P>


<div align="left"><FONT FACE="Verdana"><FONT SIZE=6>
<B>Development Phase 1</B> <FONT SIZE=4>is the longest stage intended to overhaul the whole world-space with at least one pass. It upgrades nearly all scene backgrounds and many area maps, scripts, dialogue, NPCs, world-building, quests, music, sound FX and any other content, including improved player interaction and a more animated world.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=5>
Phase 1 is split into four stages, covered by raw, work-in-progress <B>Preview Builds 1-4</B>.
<P>

<div align="left"><FONT SIZE=6>
Old quests <FONT SIZE=4>in Development Stage 1 (Preview Builds 1-4) would generally be broken or removed, though Preview Builds 1, 2 and 3 each introduced at least one overhauled version of an old quest.
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=5>The 4 <B>Preview Builds</B> making up Development Phase 1 have each had a specific focus...

Preview Build 1: <FONT FACE="Segoe Script">"Settlements" - <FONT FACE="Verdana">17th January 2020
<BR>
This release covered essential elements of the game which most players will experience often and at the beginning, including early gameplay, tutorials, training areas and main settlements. Contents were also added to the <i>Golden Realm</i> area for the first time ever. Some content was well-developed but due to it covering fundamental features some parts would be broken or clearly unfinished.
<P>


<FONT FACE="IMPACT"><FONT COLOR="#009900">
Preview Build 2: <FONT FACE="Segoe Script">"Wilderness" - <FONT FACE="Verdana">21st February 2021
<BR>
This upgraded the look of the wider mainland wilderness with new area maps and additional areas. The additional ones were thought of as 'distance maps' in that the intention was to push major settlements, landmarks and terrains further apart to widen the scope of the open world and enhance a sense of journey and exploration.
<BR>
Due to wilderness areas being far less complex than settlements, it meant more world space could be covered in this update and more of the content could be stable and release-worthy (about 70% compared to Preview Build 1's 35%).
<P>

<FONT FACE="IMPACT"><FONT COLOR="#009900">
Preview Build 3: <FONT FACE="Segoe Script">"Sun & Sky" - <FONT FACE="Verdana">12th October 2021
<BR>
This release covered the <i>Eastern Isles</i>, featuring the boat trip map between the overhauled <i>Sunnyville</i> town and back to <i>Cityport</i> on the mainland. It included updates to the desert areas, revamped a dungeon and tweaked a couple of sky areas.
<BR>
The in-game readable item, <i>Traveller's Guide</i>, was also updated in line with the new content.
<BR>
This was the first build in which 100% of the content could be playable and stable.

Preview Builds are raw, work-in-progress material for testing purposes.
<BR>
It is necessary to uncheck 'Avoid modified quest files' for characters used or created in Preview Builds.
<P>


<FONT FACE="IMPACT"><FONT COLOR="#dd0000">
Preview Build 4: <FONT FACE="Segoe Script">"Untitled" - <FONT FACE="Verdana">E.T.A. 2022
<BR>
This build will complete a first pass across the whole world-space, covering the far north-westerly areas of <i>Shiverton</i>, <i>Icy Waste</i> and <i>Gemstone Mine</i>. It will probably also include a mountainous area called <i>Rocky Heights</i>.
<BR>
With just four maps it will be the smallest build so far with 100% stable content, ie. 'release-worthy.'

<B>Development Phase 2</B> <FONT SIZE=4>will be a second pass over the new content from Preview Builds 1 and 2 (because builds 3 and 4 should already be stable). During this phase raw builds will be much smaller in scope and focus in detail on specific things. This means they can be released more quickly and regularly.
<BR>
The priority will be to ensure everything that needs to be there is there and that it's all stable, ie. 'release-worthy' so official and playable versions can resume.
